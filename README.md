# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipes website that serves to consolidate the lessons about basic HTML elements. The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

This initial version does not look pretty since it was built using only HTML. In the future this project will be revisited with the purpose of styling it with CSS.
